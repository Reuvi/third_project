When macking a level you need some sort of layout to create a level
A level map is essentially a design of what the level would look likes
- Y axis is indexes in the list
- x Axis is indexes of the strings from that list
import other files to be used with * to get everything
pygame.Surface() is like a display surface but its not the main one so you can basically make dumb models with it for testing

We are setting up the level data by creating a false map first in a list of strings and then
looping through said list for everyone colum and then looping through every piece in string to get every cell

Okay so basicaly we make level map and make player movement with vectors
vectors are bvetter for moving player cords
we then move the world if player gets to close to border of radius
also we have it where it could fit any sized screen_width
